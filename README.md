## üìö Overview

This project implements **Spectral Clustering** for both **Graphs** and **Hypergraphs** using synthetic and real-world datasets.  
For this major project, I have taken the **ERC-721 transaction dataset** for the **month of January 2020**. We analyze eigenvalues, perform clustering, and evaluate the quality using **Silhouette Score** and clustering metrics like **DB Index** and **Calinski-Harabasz Index (CH)**.

Additionally, it includes visualizations of eigenvalue spectra, clustered graphs, and a comparative analysis between Graph and Hypergraph clustering.

## üìí Main Notebooks

- **`blockchain.ipynb`**: *Spectral Clustering on Blockchain Transaction Data*  
  This notebook focuses on applying spectral clustering techniques to analyze blockchain transaction data, specifically using the **ERC-721 dataset for January 2020**.
  - **Multiple Clusters Eigenvalue Spectrum on 1st Jan, 2020**: Analyze the eigenvalue spectrum of the graph representing transactions on January 1st, 2020.
  - **Clustering for all days of January 2020**: Perform clustering on the transaction data for every day in January 2020 to identify patterns and trends in the transactions.
  - **Calculation of Clustering Metrics**: Evaluate the quality of the clusters using standard clustering metrics such as:
    - **Silhouette Score**: Measure the cohesion and separation of the clusters.
    - **DB Index**: Assess the compactness and separation of the clusters.
    - **Calinski-Harabasz Index (CH)**: Evaluate the overall quality of the clustering solution.
  - **Hypergraph Clustering**: Apply hypergraph clustering to the ERC-721 transaction data, treating each token as a hyperedge.
  - **Comparison of Graph vs Hypergraph Clustering Methods**: Compare the results and performance of spectral clustering on traditional graphs versus hypergraphs.

- **`real_life_dataset.ipynb`**: *Hypergraph Clustering on Real-World Datasets*  
  This notebook explores the application of spectral clustering on a real-world dataset, demonstrating the technique on a **Dartboard.csv** dataset.
  - **Clustering on Real Life Dataset (Dartboard.csv)**: Apply hypergraph clustering to the Dartboard dataset to understand how clustering can be used in practical scenarios with real-world data.
